# ScriptableReactive
This repostory is meant to be used as a submodule inside a Unity Project

Requires UniRX: https://github.com/neuecc/UniRx
UniRX is a reactive framework, making it possible to handle events and data, in extremly flexible ways.

This library adds onto that functionallity, by being able to define const data, reactive properties, reactive events, through scriptable objects. This is great for decoupling

to work with scriptable objects
